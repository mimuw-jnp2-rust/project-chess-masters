## Description
Our project is going to be a chess game for 2 players with some cool animations made using Bevy game engine.

## Features
- Chess gui
- Possibility to play with another player on one screen
- Possibility to play with bot who will be getting knowledge from some chess API(optional)

## Plan

Part I
we're going to implement the basic look of the board and moves of figures.
This would let us play a game against another player. This includes:
- spawning a chess board
- spawning chess pieces on the board
- implementing player's move (only correct moves allowed)


Part II
In the second part we're going to add more animations to the game, better interface and possibility to play with bot(optional)

## Libraries
- Bevy for animations and menu screens.
