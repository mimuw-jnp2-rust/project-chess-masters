## Description
Our project is a chess game for 2 players with some cool animations made using Bevy game engine.
Important notice! To play with bot you have to install stockfish. To do so paste this into terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install stockfish
```

And approve it with your password.

## Features
- Chess gui
- Possibility to play with another player on one screen
- Possibility to play with bot who will be getting knowledge from some chess API(optional)

## Plan

Part I
we're going to implement the basic look of the board and moves of figures.
This would let us play a game against another player. This includes:

- spawning a chess board
- spawning chess pieces on the board
- implementing player's move (only correct moves allowed)


Part II
In the second part we're going to add more animations to the game, better interface and possibility to play with bot(optional)

The plan was fully implemented.

## Libraries
- Bevy for animations and menu screens.
